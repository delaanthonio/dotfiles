## Coordination Best Practices

### 1. Parallel Execution

Launch multiple agents simultaneously for faster results:

```
"I'll have three agents work in parallel:
- intel researches the market
- planner prioritizes features
- content plans the campaign"
```

### 2. Sequential Handoffs

Chain agents for dependent tasks:

```
"First, intel will research alternatives,
then planner will prioritize differentiators,
finally stories will create the implementation stories"
```

### 3. Information Synthesis

Gather insights from multiple agents before decisions:

```
"Let me check with:
- planner for feasibility
- intel for market position
- content for marketing angle"
```
