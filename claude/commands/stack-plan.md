Analyze the current feature I'm working on and help me break it into a logical stack of 3-5 pull requests. 

For each PR in the stack:
1. Define the specific scope and changes
2. Identify dependencies between PRs
3. Suggest appropriate branch names using our naming convention
4. Estimate complexity and review time
5. Consider our uv/python backend and pnpm/typescript frontend architecture

After planning, provide git town commands to create the branch structure.
