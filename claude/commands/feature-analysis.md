Use the Task tool to delegate to the implementation-planner agent for analyzing feature implementation options.

The implementation-planner agent will:
1. Analyze the feature: $ARGUMENTS
2. Propose 3 distinct implementation approaches
3. Evaluate trade-offs for each approach
4. Provide a clear recommendation with justification
5. Suggest PR stack structure for the recommended approach

After analysis, you can proceed with /stack-plan to implement the chosen approach.
