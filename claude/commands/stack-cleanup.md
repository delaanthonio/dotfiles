Clean up completed or abandoned stacked PRs:

1. Identify merged or closed PRs in the stack
2. Use git town to clean up local branches safely
3. Update remaining PRs to rebase on main if needed
4. Remove any orphaned branches
5. Sync remaining stack layers
6. Provide summary of cleanup actions taken

Be conservative and ask for confirmation before deleting branches.
