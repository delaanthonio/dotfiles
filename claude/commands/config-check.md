# Configuration Consistency Check

Verify that configurations are consistent across different shells and tools:

1. Check that zsh and fish shell configurations don't conflict
2. Verify that environment variables are set consistently
3. Ensure PATH modifications work in both shells
4. Check that aliases/abbreviations are equivalent where possible
5. Verify that editor configurations work from both shells

Focus on:
- Shell prompt configurations (Starship)
- Editor integrations (Emacs, Neovim)
- Tool paths and environment variables
- Git configurations and aliases
- Development tool setups (Node, Python, etc.)
