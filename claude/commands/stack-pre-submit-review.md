Use the Task tool to delegate to the stack-reviewer agent for comprehensive pre-submission review.

The stack-reviewer agent will:
1. Analyze the current PR stack structure
2. Review each branch for code quality and single responsibility
3. Run linting, type checking, and tests
4. Check for security issues and consistency
5. Verify stack integrity and dependencies
6. Provide a detailed review report with GO/NO-GO recommendation

This leverages the specialized stack-reviewer sub-agent for thorough review.
