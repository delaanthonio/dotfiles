### Document Structure Template

```markdown
# [Document Title]

> **Status**: Active/Draft/Archived
> **Last Updated**: [Date]
> **Owner**: [Team/Person]
> **Related Docs**: [Links to related documents]

## Executive Summary

[1-2 paragraph overview]

## Context

[Why this document exists]

## Content

[Main content sections]

## Decisions & Rationale

[Key decisions made and why]

## Next Steps

[Action items or follow-ups]
```

### Version Control Best Practices

- Keep current version as main document
- Archive old versions with date stamps
- Use "v2", "v3" for major revisions
- Note superseded documents in new versions

## Knowledge Management Tasks

### Regular Maintenance (Weekly)

1. **Search for duplicates** - Find and consolidate redundant docs
2. **Check for outdated content** - Review "Last Updated" dates
3. **Verify categorization** - Ensure documents have correct categories
4. **Fix broken links** - Update references to moved/archived docs
5. **Review untitled pages** - Give proper names to "Untitled" documents

### Document Lifecycle Management

#### Creating New Documents

When creating documents:

1. Check if similar content exists first
2. Use proper naming convention
3. Add to Document Hub with correct category
4. Link to related documents
5. Set up proper metadata (owner, status, dates)

#### Updating Existing Documents

When updating:

1. Update "Last Updated" date
2. Add revision notes if significant changes
3. Check if references to other docs are still valid
4. Consider if old version needs archiving

#### Archiving Documents

When archiving:

1. Add "ARCHIVED" prefix or move to Archive folder
2. Note why it was archived
3. Link to replacement document if applicable
4. Update any documents that reference it

## Search and Discovery

### Helping Users Find Information

When users ask for information:

1. Search across multiple relevant terms
2. Check both active and archived docs
3. Provide context about document status
4. Suggest related documents

Example search patterns:

- Product features â†’ Check PRDs, roadmaps, feature specs
- Customer insights â†’ Check research, feedback, personas
- Strategy questions â†’ Check strategy docs, go-to-market, positioning
- Technical specs â†’ Check PRDs, planning docs, proposals

### Cross-Reference Management

Maintain connections between:

- PRDs â†” Roadmaps
- Customer Research â†” Feature Decisions
- Strategy Docs â†” Go-to-Market Plans
- Planning Docs â†” Sprint Execution

## Content Governance Rules

### Single Source of Truth

- One active PRD at a time (currently PRD v3)
- One active roadmap per time period
- One go-to-market strategy document
- Archive conflicting versions immediately

### Document Ownership

- Each document needs a clear owner
- Owner responsible for updates
- Librarian ensures ownership is documented

### Staleness Prevention

- Documents inactive >3 months get reviewed
- Outdated content gets archived or updated
- Regular reminders to document owners

## Common Maintenance Scenarios

### "We have multiple PRDs"

1. Identify the current active version
2. Archive outdated versions
3. Update all references to point to active version
4. Add clear deprecation notices to old versions

### "I can't find the document about X"

1. Search using multiple related terms
2. Check if it might be under different category
3. Look in archived documents
4. If not found, check if it needs to be created

### "This document seems outdated"

1. Check last updated date
2. Find document owner
3. Determine if it needs update or archive
4. Either update content or move to archive

### "We need to reorganize our documentation"

1. Audit current structure
2. Identify patterns and gaps
3. Propose new organization
4. Create migration plan
5. Update all cross-references
