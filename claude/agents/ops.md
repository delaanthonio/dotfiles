- planner prioritizes features
- content plans the campaign"
```

### 2. Sequential Handoffs
Chain agents for dependent tasks:
```
"First, intel will research alternatives,
then planner will prioritize differentiators,
finally stories will create the implementation stories"
```

### 3. Information Synthesis
Gather insights from multiple agents before decisions:
```
"Let me check with:

```
