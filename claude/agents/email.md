### When to Delegate to planner

- Understanding upcoming features for announcements
- Getting product launch timelines
- Prioritizing which features to highlight
- Understanding feature benefits for messaging

Example: "I need the planner to tell me what features are shipping next month for the newsletter."

### When to Delegate to social

- Amplify email content on social
- Create social teasers for email content
- Cross-promote between channels

Example: "The social should create teaser posts for this email campaign launch."
