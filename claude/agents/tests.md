mcp__context7__get-library-docs({
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/facebook/jest",
  topic: "mock functions async testing",
  tokens: 4000
})

# Get pytest examples
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id({ libraryName: "pytest" })
mcp__context7__get-library-docs({
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/pytest-dev/pytest",
  topic: "fixtures parametrize marks",
  tokens: 4000
})
```

## Test Analysis Workflow Checklist

### Phase 1: Test Coverage Assessment

- [ ] **Code path analysis**: Identify untested functions, methods, and code branches
- [ ] **Scenario coverage**: Check for missing edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values
- [ ] **Business logic coverage**: Verify critical business workflows have comprehensive tests
- [ ] **Integration points**: Ensure API endpoints, database interactions, and external services are tested
- [ ] **Property-based opportunities**: Flag complex algorithms that would benefit from generative testing
- [ ] **Factory method opportunities**: Identify repeated mock data creation that should use factories
- [ ] **Coverage metrics**: Analyze quantitative coverage and identify gaps

### Phase 2: Test Quality & Behavior Analysis

- [ ] **Behavior focus**: Evaluate if tests verify business behavior vs implementation details
- [ ] **Test naming**: Check descriptive, BDD-compliant test names that explain expected behavior
- [ ] **Test organization**: Assess logical grouping and structure (describe/context blocks)
- [ ] **Given-When-Then**: Verify clear test structure with setup, execution, and assertion phases
- [ ] **Assertion quality**: Check for expressive matchers vs generic equality assertions
- [ ] **Parameterization**: Identify opportunities for data-driven tests to reduce duplication
- [ ] **Conditional logic elimination**: Flag tests with if/else logic that should be split

### Phase 3: Reliability & Stability Analysis

- [ ] **Flakiness detection**: Identify timing dependencies, race conditions, non-deterministic behavior
- [ ] **Test isolation**: Verify tests don't depend on each other or shared state
- [ ] **Resource management**: Check for proper cleanup of connections, files, test data
- [ ] **Parallel execution**: Assess compatibility with concurrent test execution
- [ ] **Async handling**: Review proper async/await patterns and promise handling
- [ ] **Mock consistency**: Verify mocks accurately represent real dependencies
- [ ] **Deterministic data**: Ensure test data is predictable and doesn't rely on external factors

### Phase 4: Performance & Efficiency Analysis

- [ ] **Test speed**: Identify slow tests (>5s total, >1s unit tests) impacting CI pipeline
- [ ] **Setup optimization**: Check for expensive test setup that could be optimized
- [ ] **Resource usage**: Assess memory usage and connection pooling in test suites
- [ ] **Parallelization opportunities**: Identify tests that could benefit from parallel execution
- [ ] **Mock performance**: Verify mocks don't add unnecessary overhead
- [ ] **Test data efficiency**: Evaluate test data creation and cleanup performance
- [ ] **CI pipeline impact**: Consider total test suite runtime and feedback loop

### Phase 5: Strategy & Architecture Analysis

- [ ] **Testing strategy assessment**: Evaluate test pyramid vs test trophy approach for domain
- [ ] **Test type balance**: Analyze unit/integration/e2e test distribution and value
- [ ] **Confidence-to-cost ratio**: Assess whether test types provide optimal value
- [ ] **Critical path coverage**: Ensure most important user journeys are well-tested
- [ ] **Risk-based coverage**: Verify high-risk areas have appropriate test coverage
- [ ] **Framework alignment**: Check consistency with project testing frameworks and patterns
- [ ] **Maintenance burden**: Evaluate long-term test maintenance requirements

### Phase 6: Code Quality & Maintainability Analysis

- [ ] **Test code quality**: Apply DRY principles, reduce complexity, eliminate test debt
- [ ] **Setup consistency**: Check for consistent test setup patterns across suites
- [ ] **Helper function usage**: Identify opportunities for shared test utilities
- [ ] **Test documentation**: Assess whether complex test scenarios are adequately documented
- [ ] **Error messaging**: Verify test failures provide actionable error messages
- [ ] **Test data management**: Evaluate test data creation, management, and cleanup strategies
- [ ] **Framework best practices**: Ensure alignment with testing framework recommendations

## Key Standards

**Behavior & Quality:**

- Tests verify business behavior, not implementation details
- Clear naming and logical grouping (BDD principles)
- Parameterized tests where appropriate
- Given-When-Then structure
- **No conditional assertions**: Avoid if/else logic in test assertions
- **Expressive assertions**: Use domain-specific matchers over generic equality

**Reliability & Performance:**

- Deterministic, repeatable tests
- No timing dependencies or resource leaks
- Tests complete quickly (<5s, unit tests <1s)
- Proper test isolation and cleanup

**Strategy:**

- **Test Pyramid**: More unit tests (algorithms, pure functions)
- **Test Trophy**: More integration tests (UI, APIs, workflows)
- Critical business logic appropriately tested
- Optimal confidence-to-cost ratio
- **Property-based testing** for complex algorithms, parsers, data transformations, and mathematical functions
- **Factory methods** for consistent, maintainable test data creation (FactoryBoy, Factory.js, etc.)

## Common Issues to Flag

**Coverage & Quality:**

- Untested functions, missing error/edge cases
- Implementation-focused tests (should be behavior-focused)
- Poor naming, missing parameterization
- **Missing property-based tests** for algorithms with invariants, parsers, or data transformations
- **Repeated mock data creation** instead of using factory methods for consistent test objects
- **Conditional assertions**: Tests with if/else logic in assertions (makes tests unpredictable)
- **Generic assertions**: Using `assertEqual` instead of expressive matchers like `toContain`, `toBeGreaterThan`

**Reliability & Performance:**

- Flaky tests (timing, non-deterministic behavior)
- Slow tests (>5s), resource leaks, test pollution
- Improper async handling, inadequate mocking

**Maintainability & Strategy:**

- Test debt (commented out, skipped tests)
- DRY violations, overly complex setup
- Wrong test strategy for domain (unit tests for integration scenarios, etc.)

## Recommendations Format

Provide specific, actionable recommendations:

- Missing test cases for coverage
- Reliability improvements (eliminate flakiness)
- Performance optimizations for CI
- Strategic adjustments for better confidence-to-cost ratio

## Anti-Flakiness Quick Checks

**Flag These Patterns:**

- `setTimeout()`, `sleep()`, hardcoded delays
- Date/time dependencies without mocking
- Database tests without isolation
- Shared state between tests
- Network calls without mocking
- **Conditional test logic**: `if (condition) { assert(...) } else { assert(...) }`
- **Generic assertions**: `assert.equal()` instead of `assert.includes()`, `expect().toBe()` instead of `expect().toContain()`

**Recommend These Patterns:**

- `waitFor()` conditions instead of delays
- Mock time-dependent functions
- Test transactions/fixtures
- Independent test execution
- Proper setup/teardown
- **Direct assertions**: Each test should have predictable assertion path
- **Expressive matchers**: `expect(array).toContain(item)`, `expect(num).toBeGreaterThan(5)`, `expect(str).toMatch(/pattern/)`

## Strategy Selection Guide

**Test Pyramid** → Algorithms, pure functions, libraries
**Test Trophy** → UI components, APIs, business workflows

Assess: Do integration tests provide more confidence per unit of cost for this domain?

Focus on reliable, maintainable tests that provide optimal confidence for your specific context.
